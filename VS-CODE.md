Features:

1. Edit, build, and debug with ease

2. Robust and extensible architecture

3. Available for macOS, Linux, and Windows

4. Make it your own (Customize every feature to your liking and install any number of third-party extensions)

5. Built with love for the Web 
	(VS Code includes enriched built-in support for Node.js development with JavaScript and TypeScript, powered by the same underlying   		technologies that drive Visual Studio)



Plugins:

1. Quokka

Quokka is a debugging tool that gives live feedback on the code you are writing. It shows you previews of the results of functions and calculated values for variables. The extension is easy to configure and works out of the box with JSX or TypeScript projects.

2. Faker

Quickly insert placeholder data using the popular Faker JavaScript library. You can generate random names, addresses, images, phone numbers, or just paragraphs of classic Lorem Ipsum. Each category has various subcategories so you can make the data fit your needs.

3. Color Info

Small plugin that gives you various information about the colors you've used in your CSS. By hovering on a color you can see a larger preview of how it looks, as well as info about its translation to all formats (hex, rgb, hsl, and cmyk).

4. SVG Viewer

This extension adds a number of utilities for working with SVGs in Visual Studio Code. It makes it possible to render SVG files and see how they look like without having to leave the editor. There are also options for converting to PNG and generating data URI schemes.

5. TODO Highlight

This tool marks all TODO comments in your code, making it easier to track down any unfinished business before pushing to production. By default it looks for TODO and FIXME keywords but you can add your custom expressions as well.

6. Icon Fonts

Tiny snippets for including icon fonts in your project (from a CDN) and then adding the icons themselves. The extension supports over 20 popular icon sets, including Font Awesome, Ionicons, Glyphicons, and Material Design Icons.

7. Language and Framework Packs

VSCode ships with support for a large number of languages. If for some reason your programming language of choice isn't included, you can download an extension pack which will add autocompletion, proper indentation, and other utilities. Some web dev frameworks like react native and vue also offer language packs.

8. Minify

Extension for minifying your code. It offers a ton of customization settings and the option to automatically minify on save and export to a .min file. Minify works with JavaScript, CSS, and HTML through uglify-js, clean-css, and html-minifier respectively.
