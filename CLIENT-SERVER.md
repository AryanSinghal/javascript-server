How a request get served?

Web Server accepts request and responds to Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) requests. Browsers such as Netscapeâ„¢ Communicator communicate using several protocols including HTTP and FTP. 

The transfer of resources happens using TCP (Transmission Control Protocol). In viewing this webpage, TCP manages the channels between your browser and the server. TCP is used to manage many types of internet connections in which one computer or device wants to send something to another. HTTP is the command language that the devices on both sides of the connection must follow in order to communicate.

Once the TCP connection is established, the client sends a HTTP GET request to the server to retrieve the webpage it should display. After the server has sent the response, it closes the TCP connection. If you open the website in your browser again, or if your browser automatically requests something from the server, a new connection is opened which follows the same process described above.

As a quick summary, the HTTP/1.1 protocol works as follows:

* The client (usually a browser) opens a connection to the server and sends a request.
* The server processes the request, generates a response, and closes the connection if it finds a Connection: Close header.
* The request consists of a line indicating a method such as GET or POST, a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) indicating which resource is being requested, and an HTTP protocol version separated by spaces.
* This is normally followed by a number of headers, a blank line indicating the end of the headers, and sometimes body data. Headers may provide various information about the request or the client body data. Headers are typically only sent for POST and PUT methods.
